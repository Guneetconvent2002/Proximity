# Python-data-sharing-app
Just a small personal project trying to create an airdrop alternative for android and windows since there is app that works nearly as intuitively as airdrop in transferring data from android to windows and vice-versa
There is no way in python to command android to automatically turn on the wifi hotspot and that is needed since this app would run either on an Ad-Hoc connection or P2P (Wifi direct)
