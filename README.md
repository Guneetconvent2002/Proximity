# Python-data-sharing-app
Just a small personal project trying to create an airdrop alternative for android and windows since there is app that works nearly as intuitively as airdrop in transferring data from android to windows and vice-versa. The only reason for me using python is because I want to see what are the limits of python in terms of software dovelopment rather than data science or machine learning

There is no way in python to command android to automatically turn on the wifi hotspot and that is needed since this app would run either on an Ad-Hoc connection or P2P (Wifi direct)

Further app dovelopment for this app needs to be in JAVA because of the reasons stated above and that Python does not have much options to create a GUI that is presentable.
